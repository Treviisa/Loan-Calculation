Loan Payment Calculator â€“ Java Project
Built a Java program that calculates monthly loan payments based on user input for loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.
The program uses standard amortization formulas to determine the monthly payment, splits each payment into principal and interest portions, and displays a payment schedule. 
It ensures accurate rounding to two decimal places and includes total interest paid over the loan's lifetime.
